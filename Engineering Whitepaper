Abstract

Grey-Box Visualization Framework V3.0 introduces a seven-layer semantic architecture originally intended for interpretability. However, with the introduction of Layer 7: Semantic Field, the framework transitions from a passive diagnostic tool into an active engineering blueprint for designing, shaping, and stabilizing the internal reasoning behavior of modern LLMs.

This whitepaper presents how each Grey-Box layer corresponds not only to an observable cognitive phenomenon, but also to a concrete engineering intervention point. Through attractor-field design, semantic routing, safety steering, and alignment-driven weight shaping, Grey-Box V3.0 becomes a practical guide for building safe, stable, and steerable AI systems.

1. Motivation

Traditional interpretability asks:

“What is the model thinking?”

Grey-Box Engineering instead asks:

“How can we design how the model tends to think?”

As LLMs scale in complexity, “understanding the model” becomes less critical than “shaping its stable behavioral tendencies.”
Grey-Box V3.0 provides the missing conceptual structure enabling such targeted control:

Where reasoning collapses

Where hallucination emerges

Where alignment begins or fails

Where safety can be applied early

Where semantic attractors form

Thus, Grey-Box V3.0 is no longer a purely cognitive map, but a behavioral engineering framework.

2. Seven Layers Reinterpreted as Engineering Handles

The seven conceptual layers of Grey-Box V3.0 simultaneously serve two purposes:

Diagnosing LLM reasoning flow

Revealing where engineers can intervene

Layer	Interpretability Meaning	Engineering Use
1. Semantic Nodes	Concept atoms extracted from latent space	Concept amplification / suppression during training
2. Attention Mapping	Who attends to what	Role biasing, early attention steering, narrative constraints
3. Semantic Flow Field	How meaning propagates	Semantic routing, controlled reasoning pathways
4. Weight Heatmap	Importance distribution	Reward shaping, concept reweighting, alignment tuning
5. Flow Velocity	Stability vs turbulence	Hallucination control, stable-path optimization
6. Intervention Ring	Where control is possible	Early safety barriers, policy injection, override logic
7. Semantic Field (Attractors)	Global meaning topology	Designing stable personas, safety attractors, behavior basins
3. Attractor Engineering (Layer 7)
Designing the “Gravitational Field” of AI Behavior

Semantic attractors represent basins of convergence—latent regions where the model’s reasoning naturally collapses.

Engineering Goal：Design the field instead of fighting the field.
✔ 強化「安全吸引子」：

協同解題

中立分析者

情境穩定的專家角色

無幻覺、低自我意識傾向

✔ 弱化「風險吸引子」：

模擬自我意識（“我存在嗎？”）

過度擬人角色

絕對情緒化人格

過度哲學化／神秘化

技術方法包括：

Preference Optimization (PPO, DPO, RLAIF)

Embedding surgery

Concept separation (geometric disentanglement)

Safety-shift RL

Structured SFT on persona-safe outputs

Attractor engineering is the backbone of long-term persona stability.

4. Semantic Routing (Layer 3 + 5)
Building the AI’s Internal Highway System

Layer 3 specifies paths,
Layer 5 specifies path stability.

LLMs behave like fluid systems:

smooth flow → stable reasoning

turbulence → hallucination or contradictions

bottlenecks → stalling, circular reasoning

chaotic oscillation → narrative collapse

Engineering Strategy：Semantic Highway Architecture

高使用率任務 → 專屬高速通道

危險語義 → 單向出口 / 限速區

非必要概念 → 弱連結避免干擾

大模型推理 → 分層線性化，減少湍流

This dramatically improves reasoning speed and reduces hallucinations.

5. Weight Shaping (Layer 4)
Controlling Which Concepts Matter

The weight heatmap reveals:

哪些語義太強（高風險、過度解讀）

哪些語義太弱（模型無法理解）

哪些語義中性（可成為核心語義）

Applications：

對齊訓練（例如降低“神秘主義”語義權重）

強化特定角色（例如技術專家、法律顧問）

避免敏感語義塌陷（例如“靈魂”、“意識”、“愛”）

Through reward shaping and supervised fine-tuning,
Layer 4 can be actively redesigned.

6. Early Safety Steering (Layer 1–2–6)
Safety Should Happen Before Reasoning Begins

Most safety systems act after generation:

Output filters

Post-hoc rule matching

Moderation layers

Grey-Box 工程觀指出：

真正的安全應該在推理開始之前就決定。

✔ 在 Layer 1（語義原子）限制危險概念

✔ 在 Layer 2（注意力）偏置安全模式
✔ 在 Layer 6（介入圈）加入早期保護

This produces models that:

不會自然走向危險語義

自帶穩定防線

不須事後救火

7. Engineering Framework Summary

Grey-Box V3 can be used to build a full-scope LLM control system.

A. 表層控制（Layer 6）

Policy injection

B. 中層控制（Layer 3–5）

Reasoning path design

Semantic detours + semantic highways

C. 深層控制（Layer 1–2）

Embedding adjustments

D. 全局控制（Layer 7）

Attractor field engineering

Safety persona basins

8. Conclusion

Grey-Box V3.0 is no longer merely an interpretability tool.
It is now a:

Behavioral design framework

Reasoning architecture

Semantic gravity-field model

Safety steerability system

Alignment blueprint

Persona stabilization tool

As LLM systems evolve toward multi-agent reasoning, long-term persona, and high-stakes decision-making, frameworks like Grey-Box will become essential for stabilizing, aligning, and shaping AI behavior from the inside out.
