# Grey-Box Visualization Framework — Documentation Portal

Welcome to the official documentation hub for the **Grey-Box Visualization Framework (Universal Series)**.
This site provides versioned documentation for V3.0, V3.1 (Formal Edition), and the newly added **V3.2 Dynamic Semantic Engine (DSE)**.

---

## 📘 What is the Grey-Box Framework?

Grey-Box is a **model-agnostic interpretability and alignment framework** designed to visualize,
analyze, and formalize semantic structures inside transformer-based LLMs.

It provides:

- Structured layer-based interpretability
- Semantic flow analysis
- Failure mode diagnostics
- Field-based attractor modeling
- Dynamic semantic physics (introduced in V3.2)

# 📚 Documentation Index

Below is the full directory of available documentation.

---

## 🔹 **V3.0 Universal Edition**
The foundational edition of Grey-Box, introducing the 7-Layer interpretability stack.

📄 **Read:**  
[Grey-Box V3.0 — Universal Edition](Grey-Box_V3_Universal.md)

---

## 🔹 **V3.1 Formal Edition**
A mathematically formalized version of the V3 framework, introducing:

- Conceptual metrics  
- Formal definitions for Layers 1–7  
- Failure mode equations  
- Interwoven architecture theory (added in V3.1.1)

📄 **Read:**  
[Grey-Box V3.1 — Formal Edition](Grey-Box%20Visualization%20Framework%20V3.1.md)

---

## 🔹 **V3.2 Dynamic Semantic Engine（DSE）**
🚀 *New!*  
V3.2 introduces a time-dependent, dynamic structure to the Grey-Box system:

- Dynamic semantic vector field  
- Attractor migration model  
- Semantic drift derivatives  
- Interwoven cross-layer mappings  
- Dynamic intervention mechanics  

This upgrade turns Grey-Box into a **Semantic Physics Engine** for LLM interpretability.
