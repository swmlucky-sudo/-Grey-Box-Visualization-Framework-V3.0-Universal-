# Grey-Box Visualization Framework V3.0  
### *Base Architecture Overview*

Grey-Box V3.0 introduces a structured, seven-layer conceptual model for visualizing and analyzing semantic behavior inside Transformer-based LLMs.

---

## 🔷 Purpose of V3.0

- Provide an interpretable structure for semantic flow  
- Identify early-stage turbulence sources  
- Establish a stable conceptual foundation for V3.1+ formalization  
- Enable safe alignment and reasoning consistency analysis

## 🔷 The Seven Layers (V3.0 Core)

### **Layer 1 — Semantic Nodes**
Token-level semantic density regions in embedding space.

### **Layer 2 — Attention Mapping**
Directional referencing between semantic nodes.

### **Layer 3 — Semantic Flow**
Propagation of meaning through hidden-state transitions.

### **Layer 4 — Weight Heatmap**
Contextual value amplification patterns.

### **Layer 5 — Flow Velocity Field**
Semantic motion intensity + turbulence detection.

### **Layer 6 — Intervention Ring**
Entry points for modifying or steering semantic flow.

### **Layer 7 — Semantic Field**
Landscape of meaning attractors and stability basins.

## 🔷 Visual Concept (Grey-Box)

Grey-Box focuses on:

- Partial interpretability  
- Partial observability  
- Full conceptual mapping  

It does NOT require access to model weights.

## 🔷 Why V3.0 Matters

It gives us:

- A shared interpretability language  
- Layer-by-layer reasoning stability analysis  
- A structure for detecting hallucination attractors  
- A foundation for mathematical formalization (V3.1)  
- A base for dynamic reasoning engines (V3.2)
