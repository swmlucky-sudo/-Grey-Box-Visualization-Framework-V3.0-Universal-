# Grey-Box V3.1.1 — Interwoven Interaction Model  
### *Extension to Formal Edition*

This version introduces the **Interwoven Layer Interaction Model**, bridging static V3.1 with dynamic V3.2.

---

# 1. Linear Morphisms vs Interwoven Interactions

V3.1 describes a static morphism chain:

N → A → F → W → V → ∇ → S


However, this is a **structural abstraction**, not a temporal pipeline.

Real Transformer behavior is **interwoven**, parallel, and mutually influential.

---

# 2. Why “Interwoven” Is the Correct Model

### 2.1 Parallel Computation
- Attention  
- Hidden-state updates  
- Weight amplification  

These happen in parallel.

---

### 2.2 Cross-Layer Dynamics
Turbulence (Layer 5) can influence Attention (Layer 2).  
Semantic Flow (Layer 3) interacts with Semantic Field (Layer 7).

---

### 2.3 Semantic Field Is Not a Final Layer
`Φ_S(x)` is a **continually updated landscape** the model references during reasoning.

# 3. Static vs Dynamic Views

| View | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Static (V3.1)** | Explains dependencies |
| **Interwoven (V3.1.1)** | Explains real-time behavior |
| **Dynamic (V3.2)** | Adds time, trajectories, events |

---

# 4. Importance of This Addendum

This section prepares the structure for:

- Temporal modeling  
- Trajectory analysis  
- Dynamic stability  
- Phase transitions  

All of which will be defined in V3.2.
