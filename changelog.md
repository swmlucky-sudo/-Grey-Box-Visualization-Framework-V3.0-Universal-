📝 CHANGELOG — Grey-Box Visualization Framework (Universal Series)

格式遵循 Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
版本說明涵蓋 Grey-Box V3.0 → V3.1 → V3.2 的框架演進。

[3.2.0] — Dynamic Semantic Engine (DSE) — 2025-12-08
🚀 Major Release — New Dynamic Architecture

This version transforms Grey-Box from a static visualization framework into a Dynamic Semantic Physics Engine for LLM interpretability.
It introduces time-evolution operators, attractor migration models, and dynamic intervention mechanics.

🔥 Added

Dynamic Semantic Vector Field (𝑽⃗(𝒙, t))

Time-dependent semantic motion representation across Layers 3–7.

Attractor Migration Model

Defines how attractors shift under new prompts or context changes.

Semantic Drift Derivative (dΦ_S / dt)

Measures rate-of-change of meaning potential.

Cross-Layer Interwoven Dynamics (V3.2 core concept)

Formalizes dynamic feedback loops between Layers 1–7.

Dynamic Intervention Mechanics

New metric for evaluating temporal influence of external modifications.

Field Oscillation & Stabilization Theory

Describes how hallucinations and collapse form oscillatory semantic regions.

🧩 Changed

Upgraded Layer 7 from static potential field → time-evolving semantic landscape.

Refactored Layer 5 (Flow Velocity) to incorporate temporal variance.

Updated documentation structure to include dynamic flow equations.

🛠 Fixed

Clarified the relationship between Layer 3 (Flow Coherence) and Layer 7 potentials.

Corrected several ambiguous definitions in V3.1 formal edition.

[3.1.1] — Interwoven Model Update — 2025-12-07
🔄 Minor Update to V3.1 Formal Edition
🔥 Added

Interwoven Semantic Architecture model

Explanation that Layers 1–7 do not operate linearly but as interacting subsystems.

Added cross-layer diagrams and conceptual flow arrows.

🧩 Changed

Updated V3.1 formal documentation to include the new section:

“9. Interwoven Layer Dynamics (Non-linear Architecture)”

🛠 Fixed

Minor formatting issues in formula rendering in GitHub Markdown.

[3.1.0] — Formal Edition Released — 2025-12-06
🧮 Major Structural Formalization of the Framework
🔥 Added

Mathematical notation system (non-computational formal markers).

Formal definitions for Layers 1–7:

Semantic Density

Attention Sparsity

Flow Coherence

Weight Sensitivity

Vector Variance

Intervention Efficacy

Semantic Field Potential

Failure Mode formalization:

Attention Collapse

Semantic Drift

Hallucination Attractors

🧩 Changed

Documentation reorganized into a formal academic structure.

Added notation table and domain definitions.

[3.0.0] — Universal Edition Released — 2025-12-03
🌐 First complete publication of the Grey-Box Framework
🔥 Added

Full 7-layer interpretability stack.

Concepts:

Semantic Nodes

Attention Mapping

Semantic Flow

Weight Heatmap

Flow Velocity

Intervention Ring

Semantic Field

Failure Mode diagnostics (non-formal version).

Initial documentation & repo structure.

📌 Notes

This changelog covers accumulated developments in the Universal Grey-Box Series (V3.x).
Older experimental versions (pre-V3) are archived and not part of this file.
