# Grey-Box Visualization Framework V3.0 (Universal)

**Grey-Box Visualization Framework V3.0 (Universal)** is a conceptual interpretability framework
for Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs).

It provides a *seven-layer* grey-box view of how LLMs perform semantic reasoning during inference,
bridging the gap between black-box behavior and low-level numerical operations.

This repository contains:
- The **V3.0 Universal specification** in `.txt` (and optionally `.md`) form
- A proposed structure for future diagrams and implementations

---

## ✧ Goals

- Offer a **model-agnostic** way to visualize LLM semantic reasoning
- Describe how tokens evolve into higher-level meaning through:
  - semantic nodes
  - attention routing
  - semantic flows
  - weight distributions
  - dynamic velocity fields
  - intervention points
  - global semantic fields
- Support **research, debugging, teaching, and prompt design**

## 🧩 Layer Overview (V3, Universal)

Grey-Box V3 defines the following conceptual layers:

1. **Semantic Nodes**  
   Atomic semantic units derived from token embeddings and local context.

2. **Attention Mapping**  
   Directed relationships between nodes: “which meaning looks at which meaning”.

3. **Semantic Flow**  
   Integrated attention patterns forming *meaning propagation paths* across layers.

4. **Weight Heatmap**  
   Relative importance of nodes or features at a given step (saliency / feature importance).

5. **Flow Velocity Field**  
   Strength, direction, and stability of semantic movement (convergence vs turbulence).

6. **Intervention Ring**  
   All human-accessible control points:
   - prompt engineering
   - constraints
   - safety and policy injections
   - bias correction

7. **Semantic Field** *(new in V3)*  
   The high-dimensional **meaning landscape**:
   - attractor basins
   - drift tendencies
   - regions of semantic saturation or instability

These seven layers together form a **dynamic reasoning interpretability engine** for LLMs.
